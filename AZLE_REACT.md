# ICP Development Environment with Azle and React

This template gives you everything you need to build a full-stack Web3 application on the [Internet Computer](https://internetcomputer.org/).
It includes a frontend built with Vite and React, and a backend written in JS/TS (Azle).

## Get started with one click:
### Locally:

Make sure you have you have the latest version of Docker (e.g. >25) and VS Code installed and running, then click the button below

### In your browser:

In Gitpod 

[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/fxgst/azle-react/)

or GitHub Codespaces

## üöÄ Develop

When the editor opened, run the following commands to start a local ICP node and deploy the canister smart contract:

```bash
npm install # Install dependencies
dfx start --clean # Start a local ICP node
# In a new terminal window:
dfx deploy # Deploy smart contract locally
```

If you are developing in Github Codespaces, run `./canister_urls.py` to get the canister URLs.

To interact with the backend canister smart contract, you can use `dfx` on the command line:

```bash
dfx canister call backend greet '("Dom")' # Call the greet query function with the argument "Dom"
# or 
dfx canister call backend setMessage '("GM")' # Call the setMessage update function
```

To redeploy the smart contract, run `dfx deploy` again.

When ready, run `dfx deploy --ic` to deploy your application to the ICP mainnet.
The command will print a different canister URL for mainnet, ending in `.icp0.io`.
You can make calls to the smart contract on mainnet just like to the local one!

## üí° Tips and Tricks

- If you get errors accessing the canister URLs developing remotely, try running `./canister_urls.py` to get the correct URLs.

- Run `npm run dev` to see the frontend update live as you make changes.

- If you get an error "You installed esbuild for another platform than the one you're currently using.", remove the `node_modules` folder and run `npm install` again.
